# Battle Simulator

Battle Simulator is a turn based tank game based on the popular game battleships developed by [Michel Dequick](https://github.com/MichelDequick), a third year student at VIVES.

The project was an assignment for the course Object Oriented Programming with C++. Students had to build a tank game with the mechanics of the old-school game BattleShips. They had to visualize the battlefield in the console. No other strict requirements were made, so they could show off their creativity.
